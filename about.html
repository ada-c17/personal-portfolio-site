				<h2>RUGE LI (she/her)</h2>
				<p> My commitment to diversity is to embrace the difference, just like how I was accepted by the United States a few years ago. I know exactly how terrible it feels to have culture/language barriers with majorities, and for people who were mistreated only because of their skin colors is even more ruthless. We are scared of being called out by others. It's a perpetual state of worrying about being judged by others. It's a dreadful feeling, and I hope to change it.

					I practice my commitment by assisting people from diverse ethnicities and religious backgrounds. After graduating from college, I became a legal assistant in an immigration law firm. During my work, I have read many tearful personal stories from underrepresented groups. It reminded me that there are people being sadly neglected, the world should be more aware of inclusivity.
