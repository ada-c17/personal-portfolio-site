        <h2>About the project</h2>
        <p>
            This React app was my capstone project for the <a href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/" target="_blank">Ada Developers Academy</a> 
            program. I served as project lead and as a developer on a team with three other WOC developers in the program. We were 
            given four weeks to create this app. 
            <br><br>
            My first year as a high-school chemistry teacher was during the pandemic when most schools were still fully-remote. 
            I found the task of trying to teach chemistry remotely as a first-year teacher extremely challenging. I realized 
            that I needed to find online tools to assist me with giving students the immediate feedback they needed to practice 
            skills effectively. I taught myself coding principles by using Scratch to code 9 games for my students, but was 
            not skilled enough to create all the tools I needed.
            <br><br>
            In particular, I struggled to teach students to draw Lewis Structures in a 
            virtual setting.
            <br><br>
            <b>This game is the game I wish I'd had as a chemistry teacher.</b>
            <br><br>
            In fact, it is currently the only online tool available on the internet that allows students to free-draw bonds 
            directly to certain electrons, and then receive immediate feedback on whether or not the structure is valid.

                    I created our presentation video, instructional video on the website game page, and I was responsible for coding 
                    most of the game logic, which involved the following key coding challenges:

                <p class="collapsible-content">
                    The back-end database provides molecular formulas to the React app, and the correct atoms are auto-populated 
                    by converting the molecular
                    formula into a dictionary of element symbols, which then uses the number of valence electrons associated 
                    with the element symbol to generate the correct number of electrons and place them around the element symbol.
                </p>

                <p class="collapsible-content">
                    Each element symbol and its corresponding electrons must be draggable as a unit. As the electrons themselves must 
                    allow the user to interact with them, the electrons had to be their own entities. As the user drags an element symbol, 
                    the program tracks the mouse pointer and maintains the electrons at the same relative position to the element symbol.
                    <br><br>
                    Bonds that are anchored to electrons follow the electron position as it is dragged.

                    When the user clicks on an electron, the atom will not drag. Instead, if they keep the mouse clicked, a bond will 
                    anchor on the clicked electron and follow the cursor as it is moved around the stage. When the mouse click is 
                    released, the bond will do one of two behaviors:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Disappear. If the anchoring electrons were invalid due to one or both already being paired, the bond 
                                will delete.
                            </li>

                                Anchor. If both anchoring electrons are unpaired, the bond will anchor.

                    Clicking on a bond deletes it and resets the state of each anchoring electron to unpaired.

                    Serving as the group leader as well as a devleoper was challenging but very fun. I worked for about a month 
                    before the official start of the capstone coding period in order to think through much of the game logic, 
                    including creating our element symbol/electron/atom entity relationship diagram. 
                    <br><br>
                    I learned how to use Jira and planned the first sprint before the start-date, which helped us hit the ground 
                    running once the coding period began.

                    We originally planned to contain much of the project logic in the back-end and run the game using API calls 
                    to our back-end. Much of the first week was spent attempting to do this within our Django framework. After 
                    consulting with various mentors and instructors, we eventually decided to move all of our game logic to the 
                    front-end. 
                    <br><br>
                    While it was frustrating to have to make this change, the game logic I had already coded was simple to translate 
                    into JSX. Additionally, moving the logic to the front-end made re-deployment much easier, as we only needed to 
                    redeploy the front-end after any feature changes/additions. The interconnectedness of all our components also 
                    meant that keeping the logic together in the front-end made it easier to keep track of all the moving pieces.

                    There were several times where a major blocker was fixed by using the React <code>useState</code> hook. We used 
                    this hook for keeping track of atoms (position, corresponding electrons), electrons (relative position to element 
                    symbol, whether or not it is already bonded), user messages, score, whether a bond is being drawn, all bonds 
                    (which electrons the bond connects, (x,y) coordinates for both ends of the bond), if the cursor is touching an 
                    electron that is available for bonding, whether or not the atom is being dragged, molecular formula, and more.
                    <br><br>
                    The React <code>useEffect</code> hook helped us to set the game up at the beginning by selecting five molecules 
                    from the database, resetting the score, and generating the atoms at the beginning of each round.
                    <br><br>
                    Multiple times during development we could not get various pieces of state to update before it was referenced 
                    again, causing bugs. We solved these issues with <code>useCallback</code> hooks.

                    I would have invested more time in the pre-development stage in familiarizing myself with React hooks. We lost 
                    many hours to debugging problems who's solution was to use a React hook. Had I been more familiar with hooks we 
                    would have had more time to add features.
