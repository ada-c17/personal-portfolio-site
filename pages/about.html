    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <main class = "innergrid">
      <p id="p1">I'm Sophia Wagner, an entrepreneur and aspiring full-stack developer, currently studying at <a href=https://adadevelopersacademy.org/>Ada Developers Academy</a>. My background is in socially responsible finance. I'm a co-founder of a platform to that helps people see what banks do with their deposits. In the past I've worked on community loan access, helped ensure compliance with anti-discrimination regulations for mortgages, and researched eco-friendly banking policies.</p>
      <p id="p2">Some things I'm interested in right now: civic technology, interesting uses of public data, efforts to increase transparency (any industry), the intersection of public policy and machine learning, and anti-corruption efforts.
