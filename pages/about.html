  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Emily Saeli and I'm only sure of one thing: I'm here to write.  I was raised in Orchard Park, NY, but in 2012 I chose to attend Hobart and William Smith Colleges. In May of 2016, I graduated with a BA in Writing and Rhetoric. My most recent big change came in January of 2018 when I took a leap of faith and moved out to Seattle. I moved out here without a job, family, or support network but in a few short months I was employed as a content developer with GP Strategies. In September of 2019 I took the next big step in my career and began the UW Project Management Certification course. The course finished in June of 2020, in the midst of a pandemic, but I made some of the best friends and memories. </p>
  <p>  
  My work has been featured in a wide range of places, from op-eds in small town newspapers, to creative writing pieces in undergraduate journals. My subjects vary drastically, but what they all have in common is my willingness to dive deep into controversy and emerge with the strongest possible ideas.

  This site is designed to help me showcase both my work and my talents in a digital space. If you have any questions, or if you'd like to contact me, please email me at emilysaeli@gmail.com

Enjoy!
