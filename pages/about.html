        <p class="paragraph">I am a software engineering student at Ada Developers Academy. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Originally from Cambodia ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡­. After moving to the US, I have discovered my passion in programming. The pandemic prompted a dawning realization that I was unhappy at my job. I decided to step into the world of web development and enrolled in Ada Developers Academy.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The program has equipped me with several skills to hit the ground running as an entry-level software engineer. In addition to learning Python, SQL, Flask, HTML/CSS, Web APIs, JavaScript and Git, I have explored different technologies and frameworks that catch my interest in the tech sphere. </p>
        <p class="paragraph">If you are interested, please have a look at my project portfolio. </p>
