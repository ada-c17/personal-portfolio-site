    <p>Hi, ü´ß  I'm Tyrah and I'm in Cohort 17 of the Ada Developer's Academy code bootcamp for women and gender expansive folx. I'm learning
    full stack web development with Python, Flask, PSQL and React Js.</p>
    <p>Before Ada, I was a cybersecurity student studying network engineering with intent to get my certification and I plan to go back to that course of study. 
      My studies of internet systems and architecture has led to an interest in cloud technologies and I would love to develop my skills and gain certifications in this area too.
      I see cloud computing as an economical way to grow computer systems and facilitate collaboration to develop user-friendly softwares and better the lives of people in my community.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      I found footing in studying tech via clubmanship. I was a member of Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics & Native Americans in Science and formed a chapter of Women in Science and Engineering 
      at Seattle Central College with the help of the presidents of SACNAS and worked in close collaboration with them on projects and fundraisers for two years including work on a video game with the Unity
      game engine which earned placement at a student tech convention in Hawaii.

    </div>
    <p>
      I'm happy Ada and my tech clubs have given me a space to learn and grow as a black woman searching for her place in the tech industry and I hope to continue this sense of community into my career by contributing to technologies
      that encourage community, innovative ways to network and platforms to give the marginalized a voice such as social media.
