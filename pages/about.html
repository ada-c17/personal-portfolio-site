        A west coast transplant from a midwest family, I came to Seattle to go
        to college at UW and have been here ever since. My time on this planet
        has always revolved around stepping up for my community and stepping
        into a challenge. I have supervised programs for homeless youth and
        young adults, helpd trained Haiti's first EMTs, led youth activites
        outside London and volunteered with multiple local LGBT community
        groups. Always wanting to tackle what is hard, I dedicated myself to
        becoming a professional firefighter. After a 16 year career and
        thousands of 911 responses, I am pivoting from asking the most of my
        body to asking the most of my mind. I am honored to be a member of Ada
        Developers Adcademy's Cohort 17. My dream is to use the wealth and
        innovation generated by today's tech industry to improve the lives of
        our under represented neighbors. When not daydreaming about improving
        the planet, I have found time to road trip, camp, raise the best dogs
        and nurture the most fulfilling friendships.
