  Hi hi! My path to programming wasn't straight. Like many first generation
  Asian Americans, I went into college thinking I was going to be a doctor
  because it was a safe path. After graduating, I was no longer certain that
  I wanted to be a doctor. Since my family was poor, I couldn't go backpacking
  in Europe during this time of indecision.

  So, I began to work temp jobs to pay rent. I chanced upon accounting and
  worked as an accountant for six years before deciding to study programming.
  It was risky to quit my job but I am trying to learn to embrace being uncomfortable.

  Besides coding, I also began to explore something I have never been good at - art.
  I started <a href="secret.html#drawings">drawing</a> more frequently and explored
  other ways to be creative, such as taking <a href="secret.html#photos">photos</a>
  and completing <a href="secret.html#pbn">paint by numbers</a>.
