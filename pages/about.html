    <p>
      Hi, my name is Sorida. I'm originally from Cambodia.
      I am currently live in WA. 
      I am a student at Ada Developer Academy.
      I love to solve problems and take on challenge.
      I find coding is very interesting, it is like a whole new language.
       And becoming a software developer is my dream and goal.

    <p>This is my first season picking up this new hobby.
      Even though I am a fast learner, but height is my biggest fear. Every time I ski, I always challenge myself to do steeper route each visit at the resort.
      I always telling and push myself- "I can do this, I want do this". 
      I'm so pround of myself because overcome this fear is my biggest achievement.
      You got to do it, to win/get it.

    <p>This is me in Big-island Kona, Hawaii. I am adventurous. I love to travel. My goal is to travel around the world. 
      I really like the feeling sound of wave and surround with the nature. It make me feel so relaxing and relieves without thinking of anything.
      Being able to explore and experience difference cultures are the best feeling ever.

    <p> I love hiking. This picture was taking last year and also it was my first time hike.
      I still can't believe I did my first hike at Lake Serene.
      I found that hiking is very helpful when I'm stress or need to be away from computer for a bit.
      Some hike is challenging, but I keep myself motivate to hike to the top moutain.
      I always try to turn my negative thoughts to positive thoughts.
