      A little about me:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Throughout my life I've been tech adjacent in hobbies, with people I associate with, and with my studies and jobs.  Early 2022 I started attending Ada Developers Academy to move toward a career in tech. This has allowed me to connect all the little puzzle pieces together I had picked up in my life.

    <p>
      In my free time I find myself playing with puzzles and games and recently inline skating has been my outdoor activity.
