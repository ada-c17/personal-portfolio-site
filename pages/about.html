      <p>I was born and raised in Republic of Moldova. Back in 2017, I graduated from Moldova State University, 
        and I have a bachelor's degree in Psychology. During university years, I also went to a makeup school, 
        and after graduating from university I got a job in the makeup industry.
        Some of my hobbies are reading, makeup, and traveling. My journey in programming started around a year ago, when I first started learning about HTML and CSS.
        Since than, I've learned many interesting and valuable things that helped me in this journey of becoming a web developer.
