  </header>
  <section class="flex-container">
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p> I love outdoor activities (beach, hiking, biking) and food(especially anything with chocolates)</p>
      <p> I love hangout with family and friends</p>
    <h2> My interests in coding</h2>
      <p> I became interested in coding when I experienced first-hand how programming could help me analyzing a large set of data that Excel cannot</p>
      <p> As I am learning how to code at Ada, I realize that coders must have logical minds; otherwise, they cannot code.</p>
      <p> I want to learn how coders dissect and solve problems </p>
