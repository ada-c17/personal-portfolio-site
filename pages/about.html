        <h2>about</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm cathos, though you may know me by other names in real life.</p>
        <p>I'm curious about lots of things, and I've worked in many fields and pursued a lot of hobbies.</p>
        <p>I'm currently studying software development at <a href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developer's Academy</a>.</p>
        <p>I recently completed a certificate in Soul Care from the Soul Care Institute, and I'm interested in spirituality and mysticism, primarily from a Christian background.</p>
        <p>I'm passionate about coffee and tea. I was a coffee roaster at Breckenridge Coffee Roasters for four years. I currently have a 1-kilo roaster, and I roast for friends and family.</p>
        <p>I've worked off-and-on for years as an architectural drafter.</p>
        <p>I studied Soil & Water Science in college, but did not finish a degree.</p>
        <p>Decentralized, small, and low-tech technology are a big focus of my thoughts right now.</p>
        <p>I'm passionate about social justice and ecological justice.</p>
        <p>I love to tinker, cook, and make things!</p>
