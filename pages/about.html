				<b>My coding journey </b> began in 2020 when I became a public high school teacher. I taught during
				the first year of the pandemic, and was fully remote for 75% of the school year. Online simulations were
				helpful, but many features I needed were missing from the available tooks. 
				<br><br>
				After spending countless hours scouring the internet, I finally decided to make my own simulations and 
				exercizes. I used Scratch by MIT and was able to create a multitude of tools that were then adopted in 
				the other chemistry classroom. Check out <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ScienceWithAdriana/" target="_blank">
				my SCRATCH projects!</a> These tools were game changers for me and my students; engagement skyrocketed 
				as well as performance on assessments.
				<br><br>
				Finding that I greatly enjoyed coding, I took a couple of classes from MIT's open courseware and learned
				the basics of Python and computational thinking. I have since been able to combine the skills I learned
				in those classes with the bit of HTML and CSS that I had learned from creating online courses.

				<b>I was a dog trainer for many years </b> before I began teaching. In addition to teaching 1-on-1 and 
				group lessons, I created a <a href="https://youtube.com/c/FACTAcademy" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> called FACT Academy that now has over 17,000 subscribers. While the time I have 
				available to work on it, I do still upload videos a few times per year. My most popular video is about 30K 
				views away from reaching 1 million! 
				<br><br>
				I use force-free and science-based methodology, and particularly love a technique 
				called free-shaping, which is used to train zoo animals and marine mammals completely contact-free. <a href="https://youtu.be/yN5O5MltpDs" target="_blank">
				Here is a video</a> of me free-shaping one of my dogs in case you are curious!

				<b>I like to play pool these days. </b> A year ago I tried playing billiards and fell in love! My favorite 
				haunt is a gay sports bar with four pool tables. I go during my spare time and love chatting with the 
				employees and shooting pool for a couple of hours. Competitiveness is in my nature, but I'm happy playing 
				whether I win or lose.
				<br><br>
				As an extrovert, I love making impromptu friends with players at nearby tables, and have had many interesting 
				conversations and experiences as a result. One time we were given VIP tickets from a person who ended up 
				being the stage manager for a human circus show!
