              <a class="link paragraph-content" href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developers Academy.</a> I exited to find my first job to take opportunity to start my new career!</p>

            <p class="paragraph-content">In the past I did a master degree in economics and have 5 years of experience as an accountant in Russia. 
              Since I moved to the USA six years ago, I should start over my career. I asked myself, what am I really in 
              love to do? I love numbers, mathematics and I can concentrate on things for a long time. I like to do 
              intellectual tasks. I am passionate about doing logical puzzles, taking quizzes, and playing problem-solving 
              games. All of these thoughts led me to explore programming.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph-content">I am happiest when I creating, exploring and learning and thinking how to make things better. I took different 
              courses to explore Python in the Coursera and the Udemy online platforms. I took a part of the <a class="link paragraph-content" href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/course">Code in place by Stanford University.</a> 
              Today I luckily have the opportunity to be a student at <a class="link paragraph-content" href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developers Academy!</a> </p>

            <p class="paragraph-content">Being a diligent, hardworking and result oriented lady, I always work towards achieving best result on each 
              project I lay my hands on.</p>
