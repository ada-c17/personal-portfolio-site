    Whale hello there! Curious to know more about me? You've come to the right place(ish)! I'm currently drowning in coding bootcamp
    and I'm not that interesting, so there may not be much to tell. However, I will say that once, I burned my leg on a motorcycle
    and I will never go on one again. I am TOO obsessed with my cat to the point I think she is frightened of me, and one day,
    I have a distant dream of creating an animated TV show called Jacque and Bach which features a nihlistic French sky-sailor
    and his constant companion, his unbothered cat.
