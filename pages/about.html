        <p class="main-text"">  My first exposure to programming was through a summer research experience in which I wrote Python scripts
          to carry out computational chemistry calculations. This later inspired me to take an introductory computer science course. 
          After spending a few years working in chemical research, I felt there were limited growth opportunities in the field, which is what inspired me to get back to coding.
          While difficult at times, I enjoy programming as it challenges me to grow and constantly learn new things.
