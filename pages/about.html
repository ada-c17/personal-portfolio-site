        <p>I love hiking in PNW! I still consider myself as a beginner, so most of my hikes are easy or moderate level.</p>
        <p>Hikes on Mt. Rainier are my favorite, as there are so many paths and they are all beautiful!</p>
        <p>This hike is Tolmie Peak Fire Lookout.</p>

        <p>Puzzles!</p>
        <p>I love solving puzzles since early childhood, I think that's why programming is so fascinating for me.</p>
        <p>This Star Wars puzzle made of 1000 pieces and I completed it twice. Honestly, second time wasn't that easy as I expected.</p>

        <p>I love traveling, who doesn't? I visited a few countries, like Turkey, South Korea, UAE, but right now I am focused to visit more states!</p>
        <p>My last trip was to Honolulu, Hawaii. The nature is so incredible there!</p>
        <p>Another state I am hoping to visit is Alaska.</p>

        <p>If I have to choose whether I am a cat person or a dog, I'll definitely say Cat.</p>
        <p>I have two cats: Denni is 3 y.o tabby cat and Nora 4 y.o black cat. They are both were taken from a shelter.</p>
        <p>I was actually fostering both of them and ended up leaving them with me.</p>
        <p>No more fostering since then, as there is a possibility I'll leave another cat with me as well.</p>

        <p>I love the photography and really enjoy finding interesting spots to memorize!</p>
        <p>I plan one day to take a course on professional photography, but right now I am fine with taking the photos on my phone.</p>
        <p>This is a picture of flowers in front of one of the buildings of University of Washington.</p>

        <p>I also love flowers, like fresh cut and also indoor plants.</p>
        <p>It's so difficult to keep something alive, but I am still trying.</p>
        <p>Here is my small garden!</p>
