      <h1>My Story</h1>
      <p>I am a second-generation Filipino-American woman with a deep commitment to social justice and diversity. I have a love of learning and a talent for problem-solving which is why I am currently transitioning to a career in tech as a Full Stack Software Developer: Python, Flask, Javascript, HTML/CSS, & React. I am currently a student for Cohort 17 at Ada Developer's Academy with an anticipated graduation date in January 2023. As part of the program, I will have six months of tech-related internship experience by graduation.</p>
      <p>I have experience working in the aviation and manufacturing industries. I'm also an experienced digital artist and graphic designer utilizing Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator with hands-on experience with both digital printing processes and screen printing technologies. Other tools I am experienced with include: AutoCAD, production-grade CO2 laser cutters, plotter cutters, etc.</p>
      <p>I graduated Cum Laude from Seattle University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Interdisciplinary Arts, emphasis in Digital Design.</p>
      
      <h1>Why Tech?</h1>
      <p>I am half-Filipino but I can’t speak Tagalog. It’s not a language that’s taught in high schools or colleges. There is only one Filipino culture center in my community, but language classes aren’t taught there. So naturally I downloaded a language app to help me learn. I downloaded Duolingo – an app with approximately 5 million users, offering 30+ different languages – one of which is NOT Tagalog. According to the 2019 Census, there are around 4.2 million Filipinos in the USA. Filipinos are the third largest Asian origin group in the US. And yet Tagalog is not offered on Duolingo; but Klingon, a fictional language, IS. How could this be? How could one of the largest groups of Asians within the USA be absent from a language app? Why can’t I find Filipino recipes in my meal planning app? Why is it difficult to find Filipino books in digital libraries; or download a game featuring Filipinos?</p>
      <p>In all honesty, I desire to become a software developer out of pure unadulterated spite. But more than spite I want to become one out of a strong desire to be better and a strong belief that we can do better. I want to learn how to program so that I can create the type of programs that don’t currently exist for others like me. </p>
      
      <h1>Coding Journey</h1>
      <p>Before Ada, I didn’t have much experience with programming. Like many of my peers, my earliest investment with coding of any kind involved basic visual edits to the layouts of my GaiaOnline profile and posts. Posts were formatted using BBC code with simple commands. I remember spending hours online with friends feeling like the coolest 12-year-old because I knew how to turn text red or big or bold. In high school I received a more formal education. The summer between sophomore and junior year, I attended a one-month long program at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire where I was allowed to choose three different courses: one of which was Intro to Web Design. Class covered the basics regarding HTML/CSS. A skill which I used on my Xanga blog to create a page that exuded peak teenage-girl-in-the-early-2000s-on-the-internet energy. The same skill I later used as I moved onto Tumblr around 2012. By then I had learned to read and source code from other existing websites to sample and play around with while building my own page.</p>
      <p>What I love most about programming is the versatility. At work I’ve used coworker written python programs ranging from ““How much PTO will I have by X date?” to a more complex program that simultaneously creates a new project folder and adds a line of info to the team’s Smartsheet.</p>
