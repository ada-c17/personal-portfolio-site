      <p>Amber Tanaka is currently enrolled in Ada Developer's Academy and is completing their course in full-stack engineering. 
        Although they are taking a giant leap into the tech world, they still consider themselves a multidisciplinary
        artist. They’ve been performing new works, old works, and works-in-progress around Seattle for the 
        past 7 years or so. They received their degree from Cornish and R.A.D.A  majoring in Theatre with an emphasis on 
        Original Works. However, their interests span over many art forms. They look to break expectations anywhere 
        they can, and dream of creating a new form of performance that is inclusive over many barriers. 
        They have created multiple installation art pieces merging art and technology, as seen in Lusio: 
        A Night to Awaken in Volunteer park earlier this year, or Wing Luke Museum’s House Party.</p>
