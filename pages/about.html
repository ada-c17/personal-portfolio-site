          <p>
            My journey to become a software developer began slowly, quitely
            almost imperceptibly. I started out as a business analyst in the
            Finance department of a major academic medical center. A good deal
            of my work involved slicing and dicing data for reporting and
            process improvement projects. During that period, I was asked to
            work on a sofware development team providing the business
            requirements. It was while working on these SD projects, that I
            discovered a love of the collaborative process and of using
            technology to improve the lives of others. I went on to lead
            multiple process improvement projects, obtaining project manangement
            certificaton,the PMP, as well.

            functionally to web pages. I am currently studying at the Ada
