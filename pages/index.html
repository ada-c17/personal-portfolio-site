      <h1> What is stick-n-poke? </h1>
      <p>
        Stick-n-poke tattooing is the art of tattooing by hand with a needle, regardless of whether you're using a sewing needle or professional tattoo needles.  It's easy to learn and difficult to master.

      <h1> Why stick-n-poke? </h1>
      <p>
        Stick-n-poke has a lot of advantages over going to a tattoo shop and purchasing a tattoo.  Let's break it down:
      </p>
      <div class="center-list">
        <h2>It is cheap</h2>
        <p>
          Professional tattoos can be pretty damn expensive!  It can run up hundreds of dollars, depending on the size, location, and colors (if any) of the piece.  Stick-n-poke, on the other hand, costs under $20 to pick up the basic supplies for, and if you're working on yourself it's possible to make a pretty large piece on your own, provided you mete out the hours over a couple weeks.
        </p>
        <h2>It is impromptu</h2>
        <p>
          Spontaneous tattoos are much maligned, but really, the experience of throwing yourself into something without warning is exhilirating.  Whether you come up with the idea the night before or after you've already dipped the needle in the ink for the first time, that time pressure can give you some of your best creative bursts.  It's not the end of the world if you don't love the result.  Tattoos can always be removed (albeit expensively) or tattooed over and transformed into something else entirely.
        </p>
        <h2>It is intimate</h2>
        <p>
          Tattooing someone else with aught but your hands and a needle - or having someone do the same for you - is a deeply intimate experience.  After all, you've just shared art.  Permanently.  It can be a real bonding experience to share these moments with someone else, and leave them with your art.
        </p>
        <h2>It is personal</h2>
        <p>
          It's not just a product you bought any more: it's something woven into the warp and weft of your history; and experience becomes associated with it.  Stick-n-poke tattoos have more meaning.  Furthermore - they're not perfect.  Part of the reason I love the tattoos I've given myself or that others have given me is not <em> despite </em> their imperfections, but <em> because </em> of them.
        </p>

      <h1> So, how do I get started? </h1>
      <p>
        This is kind of a placeholder, but you can buy a starter kit online for under $20!  Find a piece of discreet real estate on your body to try it out on so that you get the feeling of what it's like to tattoo - I recommend the soft skin between your ankle and your heel, personally.  Start with something very simple, like a circle, triangle, or other shape.  Make sure you have fine markers to trace an outline before tattooing.  The finer the outline, the better.  Some suggested upgrades from a starter kit if you vibe with this art are, in no particular order: different needle tips, better/color inks, surgical markers.
