      <h3>Viewing party</h3>
      <p>This is my first python project at Ada. I really enjoy working on this project.
      Even though there are some wave that was challenging, but I found it very helpful and fun while doing it.
      I was learning so many new things and doing research to solve the problems. If your interested to see my full project, the link is below!

      <h3>AdaGrams</h3>
      <p>The is a pair programming project and my favorite one.
      I didn't realize how much I like working with my Adies until I started this project.
      This project guide me a lot because it helped me to communicate more, exchange ideas, and importantly being a active listener.

      <h3>Task List API</h3>
      <p>My third project is Task List API. This one I found it was a bit tricky and challenging.
        I learn how to use the routes and apply with CRUD methods to build an API.
      Also, it was very hard to do a research and understand the concepts with relationships. But I really enjoy it, this project always make me curious what happens next.
      Overall, it was a great project and I learned a lot from this project. If your interested to see my full project, the link is below!
